We have made a game called Coldspies, which takes place during the cold war.
The game is GPS oriented, which means that the purpose of the game is to go to a marker that you see on the map, and once you're there you get a mission, which gives you two options. but in current demo of the game, it doesn't matter which option you pick.
You choose a team when you create your account and you won't be able to change your team once your account is created. You will also have access to a leaderboard where you can see which of the teams are in the lead.

Motivation:
Our motivation to build this game was because it was a school assignment given to us by our teachers, in order for us to evolve our programming skills, and to get a feeling for back-end.
